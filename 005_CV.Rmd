To create my CV, a package called "vitae", created by "Mitchello Harawild" has been used. This CV .Rmd file is, however, not compatable with bookdown (which was used to create this site). This .RMD generates a pdf, of which a .jpg file has been generated and is shown here. The original .Rmd file can be found in my [public repo](https://github.com/PedroDeBos/PedroDeBos.github.io).
