# Closing words

For my free room, I was given 4 days (32 hours) to research a data-science subject of choice. As my interests lie within microbiology, I went to search for a (for me) new skill in data sciences which seemed to have much use in microbiology. I chose machine learning, as it seemed to be relevant in most if not all microbiology-related research, from antiobitic resistance to microbiota research to automated agar plate-based bacteria identification. 

I originally going specifically into image-based machine learning for atomating bacterial identifcation, however, I was immediately confronted by how horrendously difficult that would be. Thus, I decided to instead switch to some more basic techniques, like KNN-based machine learning. Then, I looked for an more realistic end-goal than an image-based algorythm, and thought that being able to use a algroythm like IDTAXA would be a good, concrete end goal.

I think that during these 4 days of time, I've definitely learned the basics of machine learning. Getting a feel for two flexible algorythms and 1 pre-made algorythm, learning the basics of how to set up a algorhythm, learning some forms of pre-processing, I've definitely learned a about machine learning in this time. Although I most definitely still could not yet apply this knowledge on a research project, I do now have a basis which I could use to, under guidance of a more advanced data scientist, set up a practical machine learning algorythm. 

If I were to re-do this entire machine-learning research project
