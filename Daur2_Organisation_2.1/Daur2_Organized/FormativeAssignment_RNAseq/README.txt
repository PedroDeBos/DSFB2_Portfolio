Directory for the RNA-sequencing formative assignment

"bam_dir", "hg38_index", "counts_dir" and  are directories necessary for performing the alignment, performing the alignment featureCount and  respectivelly. Due to the data for this formative assignment being pre-generated, these folders are empty.

"RMD" contains the final RMD for the RNAsequencing analysis. The "V1" map contains a version supplied by another student, used to bug-fix some minor bugs in the RMD file.

"R" contains a non-tidy version of the code used in the RMD file "formatieve_opdracht_1.rmd"

"SRR_identifier.txt" is a text file used by the RMD to download the correct fastq files voor analysis.

"subread-index-sam-057663-lkvOzq" is an accidentally generated index file which has been kept for consistency sake.

"daur2_formativeassignment_2_files" is a folder which was originally not in the file: I'm assuming it was added by teachers to check the RMD files I wrote.
