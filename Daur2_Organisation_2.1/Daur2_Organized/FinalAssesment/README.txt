Directory for the final assignment of daur2

"RMD" contains all RMD includes the final version of the final assessment analysis, and previous versions. This includes the .html file containing the output of the RMD files.

"R" contains the original, non-tidy RMD code in "eindopdracht_pedro.R" and contains a R-file for troubleshooting called "eindopdracht_troubleshooting.R"

"Counts" is an empty directory made for creating the count table. However, because the data for the final assessment was pre-generated, this folder remains empty.

"afbeeldingen" contains images taken out of the pre-generated fastqc-files, taken to be used as figures in the RMD files.
