For this part of the portfolio, a previously messy file organisation called "temp_daur2" has been re-organised according to Guerilla analytics principles. File Daur2_Original contains the original directory, file Daur2_Original contains the direcory sorted following Guerilla principles.

Due to space constraints on github, a multitude of files have been replaced with placeholder text files. These include:

a kraken library originally under "formatieve_opdracht2/mock2"
a subread index originally under "formatieve_opdracht1/hg38_index"
a subread index originally under "formatieve_opdracht1"
the .rdata file under the main directory
