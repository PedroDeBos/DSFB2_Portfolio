In order to prove my skills in learning a new skill on my own, I decided to delve into a completely new subject for me: machine learning in R, in microbiology. Originally, I planned on studying [this site](https://towardsdatascience.com/recognition-and-counting-of-microorganisms-on-petri-dishes-53a499283dc8) and focussing on image-based machine learning for identifying bacterial colonies. However, this was too complicated for a beginner. Thus, I started by following [this guide](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/machine-learning-in-r) on KNN-based machine learning within R. 

This guide guides you through KNN-based machine learning using the in-built R database "iris". KNN-based machine learning stands for "K-nearest-neighbour". In this technique, a computer model takes a dataset used for learning, and determines the distance between each of the different training data-points. Then, it places the to-be-determined datapoint into this web of training-datapoints, and it'll determine the K-amount of nearest neighbours (if K=5, the 5 nearest neighbours). Then it'll classify the to-be-determined datapoint based on which category has the most datapoints within that K range. Underneath is a example of this.

Important is to first understand your data. Thus, to begin, I looked it up some background information about what data iris contains. 

Iris contains 5 columns: Sepal width/length, petal width/length and species. A "sepal" is a modified leave which encases and protects the flower before it blooms. A "petal" is a modified leave that surrounds the reproductive part of the flower

We'll perform some basic visualisation on the data, in order to get a feel for what the data represents

```{r}
iris %>% ggplot(aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, colour=Species))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title="Correlation between sepal length and width",
    x="Sepal length (cm)",
    y="Sepal width (cm)"
  )
  

iris %>% ggplot(aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, colour=Species))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title="Correlation between petal length and width",
    x="Petal length (cm)",
    y="Petal width (cm)"
  )
```

We can clearly see that there appears to be some form of correlation between the length and the width of a petal/sepal. 

To further study the dataset, a table off "species", the factor that we'd like to predict using our KNN model, will be created

```{r}
table(iris$Species)
```

We can see that our dataset has 50 of each of the different flower types.

Finally, we'll also have a look at the range of data in our data-set

```{r}
summary(iris)
```
