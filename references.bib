  abstract = {Deletion of chromosome arm 1p and amplification of the MYCN oncogene are well-recognized genetic alterations in neuroblastoma cells. Recently, another alteration has been reported; gain of the distal part of chromosome arm 17q. In this study 48 neuroblastoma tumours were successfully analysed for 17q status in relation to known genetic alterations. Chromosome 17 status was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Thirty-one of the 48 neuroblastomas (65\%) showed 17q gain, and this was significantly associated with poor prognosis. As previously reported, 17q gain was significantly associated with metastatic stage 4 neuroblastoma and more frequently detected than both deletion of chromosome arm 1p and MYCN amplification in tumours of all stages. 17q gain also showed a strong correlation to survival probability (P = 0.0009). However, the most significant correlation between 17q gain and survival probability was observed in children with low-stage tumours (stage 1, 2, 3 and 4S), with a survival probability of 100\% at 5 years from diagnosis for children with tumours showing no 17q gain compared to 52.5\% for those showing 17q gain (P = 0.0021). This suggests that 17q gain as a prognostic factor plays a more crucial role in low-stage tumours. Expression of the somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), localized in chromosome region 17q24, has in previous studies been shown to be positively related to survival in neuroblastoma. A point mutation in the SSTR2 gene has earlier been reported in a human small-cell lung cancer. In this study, mutation screening of the SSTR2 gene in 43 neuroblastoma tumours was carried out with polymerase chain reaction-based single-stranded conformation polymorphism/heteroduplex (SSCP/HD) and DNA sequencing, and none of the tumours showed any aberrations in the SSTR2 gene. These data suggest that mutations in the SSTR2 gene are uncommon in neuroblastoma tumours and do not correlate with either the 17q gain often seen or the reason some tumours do not express SSTR2 receptors. Overall, this study indicates that gain of chromosome arm 17q is the most frequently occurring genetic alteration, and that it is associated with established prognostic factors. \textcopyright{} 1999 Cancer Research Campaign},

  abstract = {Pharmaceuticals are emerging as environmentally problematic compounds. As they are often not appropriately removed by sewage treatment plants, pharmaceutical compounds end up in surface water environments worldwide at concentrations in the ng to {$\mu$}g L-1 range. There is a need to further explore single compound and mixture effects using e.g. in~vivo test model systems. We have investigated, for the first time, behavioral effects in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to a binary mixture of an antidepressant drug (citalopram) and a synthetic opioid (tramadol). Citalopram and tramadol have a similar mode of action (serotonin reuptake inhibition) and are known to produce drug-drug interactional effects resulting in serotonin syndrome (SS) in humans. Zebrafish embryo-larvae were exposed to citalopram, tramadol and 1:1 binary mixture from fertilization until 144\,h post-fertilization. No effects on heart rate, spontaneous tail coiling, or death/malformations were observed in any treatment at tested concentrations. Behavior (hypoactivity in dark periods) was on the other hand affected, with lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) of 373\,{$\mu$}g\,L-1 for citalopram, 320\,{$\mu$}g\,L-1 for tramadol, and 473\,{$\mu$}g\,L-1 for the 1:1 mixture. Behavioral EC50 was calculated to be 471\,{$\mu$}g\,L-1 for citalopram, 411\,{$\mu$}g\,L-1 for tramadol, and 713\,{$\mu$}g\,L-1 for the 1:1 mixture. The results of this study conclude that tramadol and citalopram produce hypoactivity in 144 hpf zebrafish larvae. Further, a 1:1 binary mixture of the two caused the same response, albeit at a higher concentration, possibly due to SS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Location-based augmented reality (AR) games, such as Pok\'emon GO and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, have been shown to have a beneficial impact on the physical activity, social connectedness, and mental health of their players. In March 2020, global social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the AR games developer Niantic Inc to implement several changes to ensure continued player engagement with Pok\'emon GO and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. We sought to examine how the physical and mental well-being of players of these games were affected during the unprecedented COVID-19 restriction period as well as how their video game engagement was affected. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine the impact of COVID-19-related social restrictions on the physical and mental well-being of AR game players; to examine the impact of COVID-19-related social restrictions on the use of video games and motivations for their use; and to explore the potential role of AR games (and video games in general) in supporting well-being during COVID-19-related social restrictions. METHODS: A mixed methods web-based self-reported survey was conducted in May 2020, during which COVID-19-related social restrictions were enforced in many countries. Participants were recruited on the web via four subreddits dedicated to Pok\'emon GO or Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. Data collected included quantitative data on demographics, time spent playing video games, physical activity, and mental health; qualitative data included motivations to play and the impact of video games on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: We report results for 2004 participants (1153/1960 male, 58.8\%, average age 30.5 years). Self-reported physical activity during COVID-19-related social restrictions significantly decreased from 7.50 hours per week on average (SD 11.12) to 6.50 hours (SD 7.81) (P{$<$}.001). More than half of the participants reported poor mental health (925/1766, 52.4\%; raw World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index score {$<$}13). Female gender, younger age, and reduced exercise were significant predictors of poor mental health. Participants reported a significant increase in video game play time from 16.38 hours per week on average (SD 19.12) to 20.82 hours (SD 17.49) (P{$<$}.001). Approximately three quarters of the participants (n=1102/1427, 77.2\%) reported that playing video games had been beneficial to their mental health. The changes made to Pok\'emon GO and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite were very well received by players, and the players continued to use these games while exercising and to maintain social connection. In addition to seeking an escape during the pandemic and as a form of entertainment, participants reported that they used video games for emotional coping and to lower stress, relax, and alleviate mental health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: AR games have the potential to promote physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Used by populations under isolation and distress, these games can improve physical and mental health by providing virtual socialization, sustained exercise, temporal routine, and mental structure. Further research is needed to explore the potential of AR games as digital behavioral interventions to maintain human well-being in the wider population.},

The correct stratification of neuroblastoma patients within risk groups (low, intermediate, high and ultra-high) is critical for the adequate treatment of the patients., High-throughput technologies in the Omics disciplines are leading to significant insights into the molecular pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. Nonetheless, further study of Omics data is necessary to better characterise neuroblastoma tumour biology. In the present review, we report an update of compounds that are used in preclinical tests and/or in Phase I-II trials for neuroblastoma. Furthermore, we recapitulate a number of compounds targeting proteins associated to neuroblastoma: MYCN (direct and indirect inhibitors) and downstream targets, Trk, ALK and its downstream signalling pathways. In particular, for the latter, given the frequency of ALK gene deregulation in neuroblastoma patients, we discuss on second-generation ALK inhibitors in preclinical or clinical phases developed for the treatment of neuroblastoma patients resistant to crizotinib., We summarise how Omics drive clinical trials for neuroblastoma treatment and how much the research of biological targets is useful for personalised medicine. Finally, we give an overview of the most recent druggable targets selected by Omics investigation and discuss how the Omics results can provide us additional advantages for overcoming tumour drug resistance.},

The systematic review sought to explore the impact Pok\'emon GO has on players' physical activity (PA), and psychological and social outcomes. Six research databases (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus) were used. Study inclusion criteria were: (1) quantitative research published in English; (2) examined the relationships between or impact of Pok\'emon GO on PA, psychological, and/or social outcomes; and (3) included participants played or exposed to Pok\'emon GO. Thirty-six studies were included with a total sample of 38,724 participants. Players had significantly greater PA than non-players in terms of daily steps and number of days spent in moderate PA. Pok\'emon GO game also improved players' social interactions and their mood/affects. Selective attention and concentration improved in adolescents and memory improved in young adults after playing the game. Findings suggest playing Pok\'emon GO could promote meaningful improvements in walking behavior, as well as psychological and social well-being. More multidimensional research with randomized controlled trial design is needed to identify factors that influence adoption and sustainability of Pok\'emon GO playing.},

Its clinical impact and its unique biology have made this aggressive malignancy the focus of a large concerted translational research effort. New insights into tumor biology are driving the development of new classification schemas; novel targeted therapeutic approaches include small molecule inhibitors, epigenetic, non-coding RNA, and cell-based immunologic therapies. Recent insights regarding the pathogenesis and biology of neuroblastoma will be placed in context with the current understanding of tumor biology and tumor/host interactions.

  abstract = {Purpose The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system was developed to establish a consensus approach for pretreatment risk stratification. Because the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) is a postsurgical staging system, a new clinical staging system was required for the INRG pretreatment risk classification system. Methods To stage patients before any treatment, the INRG Task Force, consisting of neuroblastoma experts from Australia/New Zealand, China, Europe, Japan, and North America, developed a new INRG staging system (INRGSS) based on clinical criteria and image-defined risk factors (IDRFs). To investigate the impact of IDRFs on outcome, survival analyses were performed on 661 European patients with INSS stages 1, 2, or 3 disease for whom IDRFs were known. Results In the INGRSS, locoregional tumors are staged L1 or L2 based on the absence or presence of one or more of 20 IDRFs, respectively. Metastatic tumors are defined as stage M, except for stage MS, in which metastases are confined to the skin, liver, and/or bone marrow in children younger than 18 months of age. Within the 661-patient cohort, IDRFs were present (ie, stage L2) in 21\% of patients with stage 1, 45\% of patients with stage 2, and 94\% of patients with stage 3 disease. Patients with INRGSS stage L2 disease had significantly lower 5-year event-free survival than those with INRGSS stage L1 disease (78\% {$\pm$} 4\% v 90\% {$\pm$} 3\%; P = .0010). Conclusion Use of the new staging (INRGSS) and risk classification (INRG) of neuroblastoma will greatly facilitate the comparison of risk-based clinical trials conducted in different regions of the world.},

The frequently highly diluted occurrence of DTCs requires adequate enrichment strategies to enable their detailed characterization. However, to avoid methodical artifacts we tested whether pre-analytical processing steps\textemdash including transport duration, temperature and, importantly, tumor cell enrichment techniques\textemdash are confounding factors for gene expression analysis in DTCs. Methods LAN-1 neuroblastoma cells were spiked into tumor free BM and/or peripheral blood and: i) kept at room temperature or at 4\textdegree C for 24, 48 and 72 hours; ii) frozen down at -80\textdegree C and thawed; iii) enriched via magnetic beads. The effect on the gene expression signature of LAN-1 cells was analyzed by qPCR arrays and gene expression microarrays. Results Neither storage at \textendash 80\textdegree C in DMSO and subsequent thawing nor enrichment of spiked-in neuroblastoma cells changed the expression of the analyzed genes significantly. Whereas storage at 4\textdegree C altered the expression of analyzed genes (14.3\%) only at the 72h-timepoint in comparison to the 0h-timepoint, storage at room temperature had a much more profound effect on gene expression by affecting 20\% at 24h, 26\% at 48h and 43\% at 72h of the analyzed genes. Conclusion Using neuroblastoma as a model, we show that tumor cell enrichment by magnetic bead separation has virtually no effect on gene expression in DTCs. However, transport time and temperature can influence the expression profile remarkably. Thus, the expression profile of routinely collected BM samples can be analyzed without concern as long as the transport conditions are monitored.},

When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations.

To characterize the region of consistent deletion, we performed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies on 122 neuroblastoma tumor samples with 30 distal chromosome 1p polymorphisms. LOH was detected in 32 of the 122 tumors (26\%). A single region of LOH, marked distally by D1Z2 and proximally by D1S228, was detected in all tumors demonstrating loss. Also, cells from a patient with a constitutional deletion of 1p36, and from a neuroblastoma cell line with a small 1p36 deletion, were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Cells from both sources had interstitial deletions of 1p36.2-36.3 which overlapped the consensus region of LOH defined by the tumors. Interstitial deletion in the constitutional case was confirmed by allelic loss studies using the panel of polymorphic markers. Four proposed candidate genes--DAN, ID3 (heir-1), CDC2L1 (p58), and TNFR2--were shown to lie outside of the consensus region of allelic loss, as defined by the above deletions. These results more precisely define the location of a neuroblastoma suppressor gene within 1p36.2-36.3, eliminating 33 centimorgans of proximal 1p36 from consideration. Furthermore, a consensus region of loss, which excludes the four leading candidate genes, was found in all tumors with 1p36 LOH.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Children with neuroblastoma have widely divergent outcomes, ranging from cure in {$>$}90\% of patients with low risk disease to {$<$}50\% for those with high risk disease. Recent research has shed light on the biology of neuroblastoma, allowing for more accurate risk stratification and treatment reduction in many cases, although newer treatment strategies for children with high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma are needed to improve outcomes. Areas covered: Neuroblastoma epidemiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and recent advances in treatment of both newly diagnosed and relapsed neuroblastoma. Expert commentary: The identification of newer tumor targets and of novel cell-mediated immunotherapy agents may lead to novel therapeutic approaches, and clinical trials for regimens designed to target individual genetic aberrations in tumors are underway. A combination of therapeutic modalities will likely be required to improve survival and cure rates for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of overweight is increasing and the effectiveness of various weight management and exercise programs varied. An augmented reality smartphone game, Pok\'emon Go, appears to increase activity levels of players. This study assessed the players and ex-players' frequencies and durations of staying outdoors, and walking/jogging before and during the time they played Pok\'emon Go, evaluated the physical activity levels of players, ex-players and non-players, and investigated the potential factors which determined their play statuses. METHODS: Students in a university answered an online-questionnaire survey. The IPAQ-short form was incorporated to measure vigorous-intensity activities, moderate-intensity activities and walking. Chi square tests were used to compare frequencies and durations of staying outdoors and walking/jogging, health discomforts and physical activity levels between players, ex-players and non-players. Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were performed to assess the changes prior to and during the time when the players and ex-players played Pok\'emon Go. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors contributing to playing, quitting or not playing Pok\'emon Go. RESULTS: 644 university students answered the questionnaire. Compared with the ex-players, the players were significantly more frequent to stay outdoors when playing Pok\'emon Go (P~{$<~$}0.001), walk/jog to a location to catch Pok\'emon, to Pok\'estops or Gyms (P~{$<~$}0.005), as well as walking/jogging to hatch eggs (P~{$<~$}0.001). Players who never or rarely walked/jogged before spent a mean of 108.19~{$\pm~$}158.21~min/week to walk/jog in order to play the game which is equivalent to burning 357~kcal/week for a 60-kg person walking a moderate pace. Compared with the non-players, players were more likely to be aged 18-25~years [OR (95\% CI) 3.28 (1.28-8.40), P~=~0.013], never [OR (95\% CI) 10.51 (1.12-98.57), P~=~0.039] or rarely [OR (95\% CI) 4.00 (1.95-8.23), P~{$<~$}0.001] stayed outdoors and rarely walked/jogged prior to playing the game [OR (95\% CI) 3.88 (1.86-8.05), P~{$<~$}0.001]. However, there was no significant difference in physical activity levels between the three groups (P~=~0.573). CONCLUSIONS: Players who used to be sedentary benefited the most from Pok\'emon Go. The game can be used as a starting point for sedentary people to begin an active lifestyle. The impact of Pok\'emon Go on physical activity can provide insights to public health workers in using novel strategies in health promotion.},
